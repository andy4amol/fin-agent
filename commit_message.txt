feat: Complete attribution engine implementation with Brinson model

Major refactoring from Python to TypeScript with complete attribution analysis:

Core Implementation:
- Brinson Attribution Calculator with full BHB/BF models
- Risk Attribution framework (Euler allocation, VaR/CVaR)
- Complete type system (50+ TypeScript interfaces)
- Multi-period attribution with chain-linking (Carino, Menchero, GRAP)

Architecture:
- Full 5-layer architecture (L1-L5) with TypeScript
- Comprehensive attribution types (Brinson, Risk, Factor, Time-Series)
- Sector-level and position-level attribution decomposition
- Statistical metrics (IR, tracking error, batting average)

Documentation:
- 17,000+ lines of architecture docs (diagnosis, design, roadmap)
- Complete implementation summary with technical achievements
- Phase 1-4 roadmap with 8-week timeline
- API documentation and usage examples

Testing:
- Complete unit test suite for Brinson attribution
- Test fixtures with realistic portfolio/benchmark data
- Validation tests for attribution consistency
- Error handling and edge case coverage

Dependencies:
- ml-matrix (matrix operations for covariance)
- simple-statistics (statistical calculations)
- lodash (utility functions)

BREAKING CHANGE: Complete migration from Python to TypeScript
- Removed all 17 Python files
- Added TypeScript compilation with strict type checking
- New build system with npm/yarn workflows
